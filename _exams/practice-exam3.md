### Directions
In addition to the problems from the Exam 2 and Practice Exam 2, consider the following problems.
In the actual exam, you will be allowed scratch paper and a pencil, but no calculator or note sheet.

**Problem 1:** True or False!  Write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  For practice, try to also supply a brief justification.

* (A) The set $$\mathbb R$$ with the discrete metric is an example of a space which is sequentially compact but not compact.
* (B) Every metric space is necessarily a Hausdorff space.
* (C) Every finite topological space is necessarily compact.
* (D) If $$X$$ is $$T_4$$ and second countable, then $$X$$ is metrizable.
* (E) If a finite topological space is connected, it must consist of a single point.

**Problem 2:** Definitions!  Make sure you know the definitions from last time.
Also remember the following:

* $$T_k$$ for $$k=0,\dots,4$$ and what they are called
* metrizable, separates points, disconnected, connected, Lebesgue number


**Problem 3:** Named theorems!  On the exam, you will be responsible for remembering many important named theorems.  Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Urysohn's Lemma, Tietze Extension Theorem, Urysohn's Embedding Theorem, Intermediate Value Theorem, Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, Lebesgue Covering Lemma

**Problem 4:** 

* (A) Give an example of a topological space which is $$T_1$$ but not Hausdorff
* (B) Give an example of a topological space with a compact set which is not closed
* (C) Give an example of a topological space and an open cover that does not have a Lebesgue number


**Problem 5:**

For each of the following pairs of spaces, determine whether or not the spaces are homeomorphic.  Justify your answer.
Unless otherwise specified, assume the topology is the Euclidean topology.

* (A) $$\mathbb R$$ and the interval $$(0,\infty)$$
* (B) the Cantor set and the set of all irrational numbers in $$[0,1]$$
* (C) $$\mathbb R^2$$ and $$\mathbb R^3$$
* (D) the Cantor set and the sete of all dyadic rational numbers in $$[0,1]$$
* (E) the unit circle in $$\mathbb R^2$$ and the closed interval $$[0,1]$$

**Problem 6:**

Let $$X$$ be a metric space with metric $$d$$, and let $$X\times X$$ have the product topology.
Prove that the function $$d: X\times X\rightarrow\mathbb R$$ is continuous.

**Problem 7:**

A space $$X$$ is called **path connected** if for any points $$a,b\in X$$ there exists a continuous function $$f: [0,1]\rightarrow X$$ with $$f(0) = a$$ and $$f(1) = b$$.
Prove that if $$X$$ is path connected, then $$X$$ must be connected.

**Problem 8:**

Suppose that $$X$$ is a metric space and that $$A,B\subseteq X$$ are two disjoint closed subsets of $$X$$.
Show that there exist disjoint open sets $$U,V\substeq X$$ with $$A\subseteq U$$ and $$B\subseteq V$$.
