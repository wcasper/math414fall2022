### Directions
In addition to the problems from the Exam 2 and Practice Exam 2, consider the following problems.
In the actual exam, you will be allowed scratch paper and a pencil, but no calculator or note sheet.

**Problem 1:** True or False!  Write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  For practice, try to also supply a brief justification.

* If $$C$$ is a connected component of a topological space, then $$C$$ is both open and closed.
* The fundamental group of the plane minus two points is equal to a free group with two generators.
* A continuous function between topological spaces induces a homomorphism of fundamental groups.
* The product of two metric spaces with the product topology is metrizable.
* Any topological space which is $$T_3$$ and second-countable is metrizable.

**Problem 2:** Definitions!  Make sure you know the definitions from all of the previous exams.  Also know the following definitions:

* path, loop, path connected, connected components, equivalence class, quotient space, quotient map, homotopy ,homotopic, homotopy class, concatenation of paths, fundamental group, free group, simply conncted


**Problem 3:** Named theorems!  On the exam, you will be responsible for remembering many important named theorems.  Know the ones from the previous exams


**Problem 4:** 

* Give an example of a topological space whose fundamental group is not Abelian.
* Give an example of a topological space whose fundamental group is trivial.
* Give an example of a topological space with a connected component which is not open.

**Problem 5:**

For each of the following, decide whether the topological spaces are homeomorphic or not.  Explain.

* The torus $$S^1\times S^1$$ and the cylinder $$S^1\times [0,1]$$
* The space $$\mathbb R^2$$ and the space $$\mathbb R^3$$
* The set of rational numbers and the set of irrational numbers
* The Cantor set $$C$$ and its complement $$[0,1]\backslash C$$
* The Sorgenfrey line and the $$\mathbb R\times \{0,1\}.$$

**Problem 6:**

Let $$X$$ be the set of all $$n\times n$$ matrices with real entries and define a function $$\sigma: X\rightarrow \mathbb R$$ by

$$\sigma(A) = \sup \{ \|A\vec x\|: \vec x\in\mathbb R^n,\ \|\vec x\| = 1\}$$

where here $$\|\cdot\|$$ denotes the usual norm of a vector in Euclidean space.

* Prove that $$\sigma$$ is a linear norm on $$X$$, making $$X$$ into a normed vector space.
* Prove that $$X$$ with the norm $$\sigma$$ is a Banach space.


**Problem 7:**

Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ be topological spaces and let $$\sim$$ be an equivalence relation on $$X$$.  Also let $$q: X\rightarrow X/\sim$$ be the quotient map.

* Prove that a function $$f: X/\sim\rightarrow Y$$ is continuous if and only if $$f\circ q: X\rightarrow Y$$ is continuous.
* Suppose $$g: X\rightarrow Y$$ is continuous and $$g(x_1) = g(x_2)$$ whenever $$x_1\sim x_2$$.  Show that there is a continuous function $$f: X/\sim\rightarrow Y$$ with $$f\circ q = g$$.

**Problem 8:**

Let $$X$$ be the punctured unit disk

$$X = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2: x^2 + y^2 \leq 1,\ (x,y)\neq (0,0)\}.$$

Prove that the paths $$\gamma$$ and $$\eta$$ in $$X$$ defined by

$$\gamma(t) = (\cos(2\pi t),\sin(2\pi t)),\quad 0\leq t\leq 1,$$

and

$$\eta(t) = (\cos(2\pi t),-\sin(2\pi t)),\quad 0\leq t\leq 1,$$

are not homotopic.

Hint: show that if they are, then the fundamental group of $$S^1$$ is trivial, which is a contradiction.
