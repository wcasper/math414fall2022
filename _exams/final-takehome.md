This is the take-home exam for topology.  Do not consult with other people or use online resources.  However, you may use your own book and notes.  Upload your solutions in the form of a **single pdf file**.

**Problem 1:** 

Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ be the subspaces of $$\mathbb R^2$$ defined by

$$X = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2: x^2 + y^2 = 1\}.$$

$$Y = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2: (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1\}\cup\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2: (x+1)^2 + y^2 = 1\}.$$

Determine whether $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are homeomorphic.  Prove your claim.


**Problem 2:**

Suppose that $$X$$ is a topological space and let $$Y = \{0,1\}$$ with the discrete topology.

Show that $$X$$ is connected if and only if the only continuous function  $$f: X\rightarrow Y$$ is the constant function.


**Problem 3:**

Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ be topological spaces and let $$A\subseteq X$$ and $$B\subseteq Y$$.

Prove that the boundary satisfies

$$\partial(A\times B) = ((\partial A)\times \overline B)\cup (\overline A\times(\partial B)).$$

Note: this gives a "partial" explanation of the notation $$\partial$$ for the boundary of a set.

**Problem 4:** 

Consider the relation $$\sim$$ on $$\mathbb R$$ defined by $$x\sim y$$ if and only if $$x-y$$ is rational.

* Prove that $$\sim$$ is an equivalence relation
* Prove that the quotient space $$X = \mathbb R/\sim$$ is not Hausdorff
* Prove that the quotient space $$X$$ is in fact not metrizable.
