### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  
In the actual exam, you will be allowed scratch paper and a pencil, but no calculator or note sheet.

**Problem 1:** True or False!  Write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  For practice, try to also supply a brief justification.

* (A) if $$A$$ and $$B$$ are both sets satisfying the property that $$A\subseteq B$$ and $$A\in B$$ *simultaneously*, then $$A$$ must be the empty set.
* (B) a normed vector space $$V$$ is always automatically a metric space with metric $$d(\vec u,\vec v) = \|\vec u-\vec v\|$$
* (C) the only subsets of a metric space $$X$$ which are both open and closed are $$\varnothing$$ and $$X$$
* (D) if $$C$$ is closed and $$U$$ is open, then $$C\cup U'$$ is closed
* (E) in any metric space, the open ball $$B_r(x)$$ of radius $$r$$ about $$x$$ is always an open set
* (F) a subset $$A$$ of a metric space is open if and only if $$\text{int}(A)= A$$
* (G) a subset $$A$$ of a metric space is closed if and only if every sequence of elements of $$A$$ has a convergent subsequence

**Problem 2:** Definitions and theorems

* (A) Give the definition of a subset $$A\subseteq X$$ to be **bounded**
* (B) Give the definition of a subset $$A\subseteq X$$ to be **open**
* (C) Give an example of a metric on the set $$\mathbb R^2$$ where open balls are actually parallelograms
* (D) Give the definition of a function $$f: X\rightarrow Y$$ between metric spaces being continuous
* (E) State the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem
* (F) State the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality

**Problem 3:**

* (A) Let $$X$$ be a metric space and suppose $$U_1,U_2,\dots, U_n$$ are open subsets of $$X$$.  Prove that $$\bigcap_{k=1}^n U_k$$ is an open set.
* (B) Show by example that the intersection of infiniitely many open sets may not be open.

**Problem 4:**

Let $$X=\mathbb R$$ be the metric space of the real numbers but with $$d_X$$ the discrete metric and let $$Y=\mathbb R$$ be the metric space of the real numbers with $$d_Y$$ the Euclidean metric.

* (A) Prove that the function $$f: X\rightarrow Y$$ defined by $$f(x) = x$$ is continuous.
* (A) Prove that the function $$g: Y\rightarrow X$$ defined by $$g(x) = x$$ is not continuous.

**Problem 5:**

* (A) Give five examples of countably infinite sets, none of which are subsets of one-another
* (B) Give three examples of uncountable sets, none of which are subsets of one-another
* (C) Give an example of a set whose cardinality is strictly greater than the cardinality of $$\mathbb R$$


**Problem 6:** Let $$X$$ be a metric space and let $$\mathcal B(X,\mathbb R)$$ be the collection of all bounded, real-valued functions on $$X$$.
Recall $$\mathcal B(X,\mathbb R)$$ is a normed linear space with uniform norm $$\|f\| = \sup_{x\in X} |f(x)|.$$

* (A) Prove that a sequence $$\{f_n\}$$ in $$\mathcal B(X,\mathbb R)$$ converges to $$f$$ with respect to the uniform norm if and only if $$f_n\rightarrow f$$ uniformly
* (B) Prove that a Cauchy sequence $$\{f_n\}$$ in $$\mathcal B(X,\mathbb R)$$  in $$\mathcal B(X,\mathbb R)$$ converges to some function in $$\mathcal B(X,\mathbb R)$$ and hence $$\mathcal B(X,\mathbb R)$$ is complete
