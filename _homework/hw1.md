### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* written on ancient parchement with a quill and then flown to the instructor via owl post like in Harry Potter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**  Remember that two topological spaces are the same, what we call **homeomorphic** if you can stretch and squeeze one into the shape of the other.  The letters of the alphabet provide interesting examples of topological spaces.  Partition the set of capital letters into subsets consisting of letters which are homeomorphic.

**Problem 2:** Let $$X= \mathbb R^2\backslash\{(0,0)\}$$ and consider the relation $$\sim$$ on $$X$$ defined by

$$(x_1,y_1)\sim (x_2,y_2)\ \ \Leftrightarrow\ \ \exists \lambda\in\mathbb R\ \text{s.t.}\ (x_1,y_1) = (\lambda x_2,\lambda y_2).$$

* (A) Prove that $$\sim$$ is an equivalence relation.
* (B) Give an explicit description of the set $$\mathbb P^1(\mathbb R)$$ of equivalence classes of $$\sim$$.  This is called the **real projective line**.
* (C) Define a function which is a bijection from $$\mathbb P^1(\mathbb R)$$ to the unit circle
$$S^1 = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2: x^2 + y^2 = 1\}.$$

**Problem 3:** Let $$X$$ be any infinite set and let $$a$$ be an element not in $$X$$.  Prove that $$X\cup \{a\}$$ has the same cardinality as $$X$$.

**Problem 4:** Prove that the set

$$X = \{(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb R^3: 0< x_j < 1,\ \forall j\}$$

has the same cardinality as $$(0,1)$$.
