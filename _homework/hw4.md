### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* written on ancient parchement with a quill and then flown to the instructor via owl post like in Harry Potter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** 
Let $$X$$ be a set and $$\tau_1$$ and $$\tau_2$$ be two different topologies on $$X$$.
Show that $$\tau_1\cap\tau_2$$ is also a topology on $$X$$.

**Problem 2:**

Let $$X$$ be a topological space with topology $$\tau$$.

* (a) Prove that the identity map on $$X$$ is continuous.
* (b) Prove that if $$f: X\rightarrow X$$ and $$g: X\rightarrow X$$ are continuous functions, then the composition $$g\circ f$$ is also continuous.
* (c) Let $$z\in X$$.  Show that the constant function $$f: X\rightarrow X$$ defined by $$f(x) = z$$ for all $$x\in X$$ is continuous.

**Problem 3:**

Let $$X$$ be a topological space and $$A\subseteq X$$.
Recall that $$D(A)$$, the derived set of $$A$$, is the set of all limit points of $$X$$.
Prove, without using any special theorems from class, that $$\overline{A} = A\cup D(A).$$

**Problem 4:**  

Let $$X$$ be a set and suppose that $$d_1$$ and $$d_2$$ are two different metrics on $$X$$.

Can the topology that they define on $$X$$ be the same, even though $$d_1$$ and $$d_2$$ are different?
If so, give an example and prove that the topology is the same.  If not, prove that the topology must be different.

**Problem 5:**

Let $$X=\mathbb R$$ and let $$\tau$$ be the collection of subsets of $$X$$ determined by arbitrary unions of intervals of the form $$[a,b)$$ for real numbers $$a,b\in \mathbb{R}$$ with $$a < b$$.

* (A) Show that the intersection of two elements in $$\tau$$ must also be in $$\tau$$
* (B) Use (A) to prove that the intersection of any finite number of elements in $$\tau$$ is also in $$\tau$$
* (C) Show that the union of any collection of elements in $$\tau$$ is also in $$\tau$$ and therefore $$\tau$$ is a topology on $$\mathbb R$$.
* (D) Show that $$\mathbb R$$ with this topology is not **second countable**, ie. every basis for the topology is necessarily uncountable.
