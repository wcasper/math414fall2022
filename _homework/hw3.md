### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* written on ancient parchement with a quill and then flown to the instructor via owl post like in Harry Potter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** 
Let $$X$$ be a metric space.  Show that the complement of any finite set of points in $$X$$ must be open.

**Problem 2:**  

Prove that the interior of the Cantor set is empty.

**Problem 3:**

Prove the following properties of interiors.

* (A) $$\text{int}(A)\cup \text{int}(B) \subseteq \text{int}(A\cup B)$$
* (B) $$\text{int}(A)\cap \text{int}(B) = \text{int}(A\cap B)$$
